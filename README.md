# Data Relevance
The dataset is appropriate to answering the research question.


# Summary of Findings
- Malic acids and magnesium have the largest number of outliers.
- There is high correlation between flavanoids and total phenols.
- There is high correlation between flavanoids and OD280.
- When carrying out kmeans clustering cluster 0 had the highest number of elements.
# Recommendations
The alcohols which fall under cluster 0 should be considered as the most exclusive brands of wine more accessible at an affordable price. And then cluster 1 forms is inaccessible and expensive.

# Challenging your Solution
a) The question we had for the project was appropriate for the given dataset.
b) Basing from the results, the data set was good for the analysis.
c) To improve on the solution we need to have more observations and also perform feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to our data before carrying out modeling.
